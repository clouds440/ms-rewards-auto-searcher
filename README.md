# ms-rewards-auto-searcher
This script will automatically perform searches for you to get maximum Microsoft Rewards points daily. But you have to change the "cvid" to your own. You can find your "cvid" by normally searching someone on Bing and looking at the url to see what is your "cvid." Then copy that and paste it in the script to replace the current "cvid"
